windows terminal emulator

note: currently .sln is in vs2012 format but I will downgrade it to 2010 soon.

until then you can still use the makefile, which is portable accross vs versions.

-----
goals: 

* be utterly minimalist (no CLR/ATL)
* no external dependencies, just standard win32 libs (user32 and friends)
* not suck
* support resizing (on BOTH axes)
